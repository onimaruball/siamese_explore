Siamese Neural Network for Image Similarity - End-to-End Project
This project is an end-to-end implementation of a Siamese Neural Network to determine the similarity between image pairs using TensorFlow. The tutorial for this project is based on the YouTube playlist: Siamese Neural Network Tutorial.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a Siamese Neural Network to compare image pairs and determine their similarity. This type of model is commonly used in various applications such as face verification, signature verification, and image retrieval. The Siamese architecture is designed to learn a similarity function by processing pairs of inputs through twin neural networks.

Key Steps:
Dataset: The model uses an image dataset consisting of pairs of images.

Preprocessing: Images are resized and normalized to prepare for the neural network.

Model Architecture: A Siamese Neural Network is constructed using TensorFlow and Keras. The model learns to predict the similarity score between image pairs.

Training: The model is trained on the image pairs to learn the feature similarities.

Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics.
