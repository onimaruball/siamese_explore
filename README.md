# Siamese Neural Network for Image Similarity - End-to-End Project

This project is an **end-to-end implementation** of a **Siamese Neural Network** to determine the similarity between image pairs using **TensorFlow**. The tutorial for this project is based on the YouTube playlist: [Siamese Neural Network Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK_k7eebGgc&list=PLgNJO2hghbmhHuhURAGbe6KWpiYZt0AMH).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a Siamese Neural Network to compare image pairs and determine their similarity. This type of model is commonly used in various applications such as **face verification**, **signature verification**, and **image retrieval**. The Siamese architecture is designed to learn a similarity function by processing pairs of inputs through twin neural networks.

## Status: still in process to learning
